Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
Waxy and quivering, jocks fumble the pizza.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
When I've built up my savings, I'll be able to travel to Mexico.
After the death of the king, everyone wanted to be a king.
War does not bring anything good to the common people.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
Wouldn't it be lovely to enjoy a week soaking up the culture?

Wise men don't need advice. Fools won't take it.
So long as a man is angry he can't be in the right.
Every act of creation is first an act of destruction.
The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas.
I do not pray for success. I ask for faithfulness.
A good scare is worth more to a man than good advice.
Heaven will be inherited by every man who has heaven in his soul.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
